A bunch of Fabric commands i use all the time
==============================================

This package contains a selection of Fabric command i use all the time. By
sharing them online i hope to save someone some time. Commands contain some 
hardcoded internal stuff, so they are not really usable out-of-the-box, more 
so as a point of reference. If there is interest, i'll rewrite them to be 
more reusable.

List of avalible commands (see their docstrings for usage help):

* deploy.install_puppet
* debooubuntu.debootstrap
* debooubuntu.flash
* debooubuntu.install
* debooubuntu.mount
* debooubuntu.prepare
* debooubuntu.resize
* debooubuntu.unmount
